This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:


npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



UI/UX IMPROVMENTS:

1. Create a lighter theme and add a toggle button between dark and light mode;

2. Increase font size and line height;

3. Add effective call to action buttons;

4. Add more space between elements

5. Follow the consistency design rules (Images from the store section have rounded borders while the images from the news don't.)
