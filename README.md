This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:


npm run dev


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.



UI/UX IMPROVMENTS:

1. Create a lighter theme and add a toggle button between dark and light mode;

2. Increase font size and line height;

3. Add effective call to action buttons in the "store" page (each item could have a "Buy now" button)

4. The actual shade of red is not visible on a dark background (see Exchange section)

5. Follow the consistency design rules (The form fields in the "registration page" have rectangle borders while the submit button and login button have rounded borders.)
